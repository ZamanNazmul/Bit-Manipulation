//Answer to the question no : 2

To perform the subtraction (-49) - (-83) in 2's complement, we need to represent both numbers in binary using the minimum number of bits
required to represent the absolute value of the largest number, which is 7 bits.


To represent (-49) in 2's complement binary, we start with the binary representation of the absolute value of the number (49 in this case),
which is 110001. We then take the 2's complement of this number by flipping all the bits and adding 1, which gives us:
0011111 (7-bit 2's complement representation of -49)



To represent (-83) in 2's complement binary, we start with the binary representation of the absolute value of the number (83 in this case),
 which is 1010011. We then take the 2's complement of this number by flipping all the bits and adding 1,  which gives us: 
1101101 (7-bit 2's complement representation of -83)


We can now perform the subtraction using binary arithmetic, with the 2's complement representation of the second number 
(i.e., -83) negated and added to the first number (i.e., -49). This gives:

0011111 (-49)



1010011 (2's complement of -83, which is the same as the binary representation of 83)
11100010 (in 2's complement, which represents -132)


Therefore, the result of the subtraction (-49) - (-83) in decimal is -132.

To summarize, we need 7 bits to represent both (-49) and (-83) in 2's complement binary to perform the subtraction.
